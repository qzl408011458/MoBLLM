<task definition>
Your task is to predict a user's next destination based on his/her activity pattern.

<data description>
You will be provided with <history> which is a list containing this user's historical trips, then <context> which provide contextual information
about where and when this user have been to recently.

Trips in both <history> and <context> are in chronological order. Each trip takes on such form as (start_time, day_of_week, duration, origin, destination). The detailed explanation of each element is as follows:
start_time: the start time of the trip in 12h clock format.
day_of_week: indicating the day of the week.
duration: an integer indicating the duration (in minute) of the last activity.
origin: an integer or a name representing the boarding station, which may indicate a location closest to the place where the last activity ends or the trip starts.
destination: an integer or a name representing the alighting station, which may indicate a location closest to the place where the next activity happens or the trip finishes.

Trip in <target_trip> takes a form as (start_time, day_of_week, duration, origin, <next_destination>)
Then you need to do next location prediction on <target_trip> which is the prediction target with unknown destination denoted as <next_destination> and unknown duration denoted as None, while temporal information is provided.

<thinking guidance>
Please infer what the <next_destination> is (i.e., the most likely station), considering the following aspects:
1. the activity pattern of this user that you learned from <history>, e.g., repeated visit to a certain destination during certain time;
2. the context trips in <context>, which provide more recent activities of this user;
3. the temporal and spatial information (i.e., start_time, day_of_week, duration and origin) of target trip, which is important because people's activity varies during different times (e.g., nighttime versus daytime),
and on different days (e.g., weekday versus weekend), and different places (e.g., central business district versus residential district)
