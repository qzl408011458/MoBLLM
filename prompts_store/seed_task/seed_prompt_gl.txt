<task definition>
Your task is to predict a user's next location based on his/her activity pattern.

<data description>
You will be provided with <history> which is a list containing this user's historical stays, then <context> which provide contextual information
about where and when this user have been to recently.

Stays in both <history> and <context> are in chronological order. Each stay takes on such form as (start_time, day_of_week, duration, place). The detailed explanation of each element is as follows:
start_time: the start time of the stay in 12h clock format.
day_of_week: indicating the day of the week.
duration: an integer indicating the duration (in minute) of each stay. Note that this will be None in the <target_stay> introduced later.
place: an integer or a name representing the unique place, which indicates where the stay is.

Stay in <target> takes a form as (start_time, day_of_week, None, <next_place>)
Then you need to do next location prediction on <target_stay> which is the prediction target with unknown place denoted as <next_place> and unknown duration denoted as None, while temporal information is provided.

<thinking guidance>
Please infer what the <next_place> is (i.e., the most likely place), considering the following aspects:
1. the activity pattern of this user that you learned from <history>, e.g., repeated visit to a certain place during certain time;
2. the context stays in <context>, which provide more recent activities of this user;
3. the temporal and spatial information (i.e., start_time, day_of_week) of target stay, which is important because people's activity varies during different times (e.g., nighttime versus daytime),
and on different days (e.g., weekday versus weekend), and different places (e.g., central business district versus residential district)
