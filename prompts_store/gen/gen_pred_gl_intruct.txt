You are asked to come up with a set of 10 diverse task instructions related to time series prediction. These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.

Here are the requirements:
1. The instructions should be in English.
2. Each generated instruction should be as long as the given example instruction. Give the corresponding task title before generating the instruction.
3. Assuming that you are a mobility research scientist, each generated instruction should be related to human mobility prediction, e.g., predict next location or next trip station.
4. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.
5. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output.
6. The main structure of an instruction should include <task definition>, <data description> and <thinking guidance>.
7. <data description> have and only have 4 elements of a stay that can be illustrated: start_time, day_of_week, duration, place.
